# Riftz - Omegle-Inspired Chat Application

Welcome to Riftz, a modern, anonymous, real-time chat platform built with React, Vite, and Firebase. This application allows users to connect with random strangers for text-based conversations, mimicking the spontaneous nature of Omegle, while leveraging Firebase for authentication and data storage.

## Overview
Riftz is designed to pair users anonymously for one-on-one chats. Users authenticate via Firebase using anonymous login, join a queue, and get matched with another user in real-time. The Firebase Realtime Database manages chat data and user pairing logic, while React with Vite ensures a fast, responsive frontend experience. The app aims to replicate Omegle's simplicity and randomness with modern authentication and a scalable backend.

## Features
- **Anonymous Pairing**: Users are matched randomly with others in the queue.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Messages are sent and received instantly using Firebase Realtime Database (in development).
- **Authentication**: Supports Firebase Authentication with anonymous login.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React and styled for desktop and mobile use.
- **Fast Development**: Vite provides a lightning-fast dev server and build process.
- **End Chat**: Users can leave a chat and rejoin the queue for a new match (in development).

## Tech Stack
The application leverages the following technologies:

### Frontend
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling for fast development and optimized builds.
- **CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS (optional)**: For modular and utility-first styling.

### Backend & Database
- **Firebase Authentication**: Handles anonymous user login.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Stores chat data, user queue, and pairing logic.

### Development Tools
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for running the app locally.
- **npm**: Package manager for installing dependencies.
- **ESLint / Prettier**: For code linting and formatting.

Copy
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getDatabase } from "firebase/database";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyBxjjIQK7QfI_p4Y4j9HBNrrPE-egv199Q",
  authDomain: "riftz-71f84.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://riftz-71f84-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "riftz-71f84",
  storageBucket: "riftz-71f84.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "188220452619",
  appId: "1:188220452619:web:b9c6876853424e80bc7c0e",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const database = getDatabase(app);
Replace the firebaseConfig values with those from your Firebase project.

Database Rules
Set up the Firebase Realtime Database rules to allow authenticated users to read/write chat data. Example:
